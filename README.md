# Machine-Learning-Tutorial
This repository contains the content I created and delivered in my capacity as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UNC Charlotte for the Machine Learning in Manufacturing and Material Science course under Dr. Harish Cherukuri. This course's facts and concepts are drawn from a variety of articles and online courses. I have worked towardsÂ the curation of these materials as well as the structure of the notebooks.

# Sequence of notebooks:
1. Python Tutorial Reference Notebook
2. NumPy Arrays Notebook
3. NumPy Indexing and Selection Notebook
4. NumPy Operations Notebook
5. Linear Regression Notebook
6. K Nearest Neighbors Notebook
7. Logistic Regression Notebook
8. Lasso and Ridge Regression Notebook

# Working with the notebooks
* Use the 'USA_Housing.csv' dataset for the Linear Regression and Lasso and Ridge Regression notebooks.
* Use the 'Classified Data' dataset for K Nearest Neighbors notebook.
